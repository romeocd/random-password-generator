By clicking the button to generate a password, a series of prompts for password criteria appears. 
Length of the password must be at least 8 characters and no more than 128 characters. 
Character types to include in the password must be confirmed whether or not to include lowercase, uppercase, numeric, and/or special characters.
After answering each prompt, the input should be validated and at least one character type should be selected.
After answering all prompts, a password is generated that matches the selected criteria and displayed in the page.
